Script to convert HTML output from [[https://github.com/fabianonline/telegram_backup][telegram_backup]] tool to plaintext with proper filenames.

I'm using it for quick search (e.g. =grep=) in messages without having to go to web interface/mobile app.

Usage:

1. Read [[https://github.com/fabianonline/telegram_backup#usage][usage for telegram_backup]] to backup your account. Don't forget to run =--export html=!
   Personally I've got this set up as a daily Cron job.
2. Run this script with the same =--target= and =--account= arguments as for backup script.

Dependencies:

- ~apt install sqlite3 html2text~
